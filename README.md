# twikki
Application aiming at displaying tweets to the clients and displaying wikipedia word definition when selecting a word

## Setup

Once the repository is cloned, you can run the application on 3 easy steps. At the root of the directory: <br/>
1. run 'npm install' (please make sure npm is install on your machine) <br/>
2. run 'bower install' <br/>
3. run 'gulp serve' <br/>

The browser should start automatically the application on http://localhost:3000 <br/>
(Note: once the webpage is launched, it may take some time for the application to kick-off. But it will eventually show up)
